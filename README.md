# Introduction
This is a short reimaging of a PERN project in PHP. The original project can be found here: [front-end]( https://github.com/Richardaeld/DND_Into_The_Abyss) and [API]( https://github.com/Richardaeld/dm_tool_api).

This reimaging shows basic API consumption with a click and allows the user to input data and consume material within the API. The two boxes within the header (Rules as Written (RAW) and House RulesV1) initiate a random entry selection when clicked. After one has been clicked the user now has the ability to select a specific number within the allowed range.
