# Introduction
This is a short reimaging of a PERN project in PHP. The original project can be found here: [front-end]( https://github.com/Richardaeld/DND_Into_The_Abyss) and [API]( https://github.com/Richardaeld/dm_tool_api).

This PHP app has API interaction and allows the user to select API table entries based on their id. The two boxes within the header (Rules as Written (RAW) and House RulesV1) return a random entry when clicked. Furthermore, after one of these headers has been clicked the user can input a specific number within the allowed range and retrieve its value from said table.
